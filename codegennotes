wld be soemthing like:

-------------------------
#include <code_defs>
#include <std defs>

//generated code goes here//

---------------------------

----StdDefs----------
Registers[MAX-USED]

MM[0...1000]

--------------------


----code_defs------
#def MAX_USED_REG 4
------------------


e.g: foo = a + b

generates

R[0] = a;
R[1] = b;
R[3] = R[0] + R[1];


Assume infinitely many registers, just have to keep track and define
number in code_defs.


push activation record on the stack with:

-chain pointer
-return address
-return value
-args

Designate R[0] to point to end of activation record,
allocate space on the stack on top of stack for vars

stack is virtual, i.e. is just in MM array,
do things like 
R[0] = MM[...]
and
MM[...]=...

to add things to stack and change the stack pointer.
