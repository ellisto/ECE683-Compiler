Lexer:
make a vector of character classes.


next_char = getc();

then look up next_char, i.e.

next_char_class=character_class[next_char];

cur_state=next_state[cur_state, next_char_class]

if(accepting_state[cur_state])
	move to start state
	build token
	return
endif

DONT FORGET EOF as a token.

write an error class. look up std error format. (so things like emacs can read 'em)


Start out just recognizing things like +, -, comparisons, etc.

keep track of line number!

Make an enumeration for character classes.

For identifiers/keywords: put keywords on the table right away, then
just read 'em as ids and they are disregarded bc they are already in
table.
